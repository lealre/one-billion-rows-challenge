## One billion million rows challenge 

This repository is Project 01 from the Data Engineering BOOTCAMP, where the objective is to compare different ways of reading one billion rows of a CSV file in Python. After cloning the original repository, the goal is to make script changes based on what we learned in previous bootcamp classes (type hints, functions...).

### Results

Running in my machine, these were the results:

- Python - 2797 seconds
- Python + Pandas - 396 seconds
- Python + Polars - 38 seconds
- Python + Duckbd - 33 seconds
